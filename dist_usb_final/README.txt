MagicINFO Snake Custom App - Universal USB Fix

The "Unable to find installation file" error implies the TV is looking in a specific folder you didn't have.
This package includes the App in ALL common Samsung locations.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Delete everything currently on your USB drive.
2. Copy ALL contents of this "dist_usb_final" folder to the root of your USB stick.
   
   Your USB stick should look like this:
   [USB ROOT]
    |-- SSSP/          (Folder)
    |-- widget/        (Folder)
    |-- SnakeDemo/     (Folder)
    |-- SnakeDemo.wgt  (File)
    |-- README.txt     (File)

3. Insert USB into the TV.
4. Try "Install Web App" again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IF "INSTALL WEB APP" STILL FAILS (Alternative Method: URL Launcher)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the TV refuses to install the .wgt file directly:

1. On the Remote, press [MENU].
2. Go to [System] > [Play via] -> Select "URL Launcher".
3. Press [HOME] -> [URL Launcher].
4. Look for "Install Web App" inside the URL Launcher settings (top right corner usually).
   OR
   Simply enter the file path manually if allowed: "file:///mtd_down/sssp/SnakeDemo/index.html" (Advanced).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAST RESORT: PLAY AS CONTENT (No Installation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If Installation is impossible without a server:
1. Press [Source] -> Select [MagicInfo Player] or [USB Device].
2. Browse the USB stick.
3. Open the "SnakeDemo" folder.
4. Select "index.html" and Play.
   (Note: This runs it as a playlist content item. You may need to select "Web Browser" as the content type if asked).
